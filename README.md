Overview:
This project aims to implement robust user authentication for web applications. Whether you're building a social network, an e-commerce platform, or any application requiring user accounts, this authentication system provides secure user management and authentication functionalities.

Features:
User Registration: Allow users to sign up by providing basic information such as username, email, and password.
User Authentication: Enable users to securely log in using their credentials.
Password Hashing: Implement password hashing to securely store user passwords in the database.
Email Verification: Optionally, integrate email verification to confirm the authenticity of user-provided email addresses.
Auth.js Integration: Integrate Auth.js providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub for seamless login experiences.
Role-based Access Control: Implement role-based access control to manage permissions for different types of users.
Security Measures: Implement security best practices such as CSRF protection, rate limiting, and secure cookie attributes to prevent common attacks.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Choose a language suitable for your project (e.g., React, Typescript).
Frameworks/Libraries: Utilize frameworks or libraries such as Next.js etc., depending on your tech stack.
Database: Use a relational database like MongoDB to store user data securely.
Security Tools: Incorporate security tools like bcrypt for password hashing, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management, and libraries/frameworks that provide built-in security features.
